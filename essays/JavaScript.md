## Learning JavaScript
  In a matter of a week, I had to learn the basics of JavaScript. This included foundations such as data types, loops, and objects. Using the free JavaScript course on FreeCodecamp, I would have to learn how to code in JavaScript. This course included 142 topics and problems. Taking on a challenge like learning another language in days was extremely intimidating. However, it was not as bad as I thought it would be.
  
  My first impression of JavaScript was off to a great start, which mostly had to do with my background in coding. Specifically, having a good understanding of Java helped me a lot with the topics and concepts introduced to me through the course. As a result, I did not struggle with getting through the coding challenges. JavaScript felt extremely similar to Java so I felt comfortable with learning how to code in this new language. Although, I found JavaScript to be easier than Java. For instance, concerning the initialization of variables. In Java, we would have to include the variable type such as boolean or int. In contrast, we would only have to use keywords like let, var or const to initialize a variable in JavaScript. In this way, JavaScript felt more efficient and easier to use. The real learning came when I got to the ES6 section of the course. Through this section, I learned how to efficiently and correctly code in JavaScript up to a certain standard. For instance, we learned how to use arrow functions in this part of the course which was something new for me. In my opinion, based on everything that I have learned, I believe JavaScript is a good programming language for software engineering. The language is so versatile and efficient that it feels effective and comfortable to use.

## What is a WOD?  
  After learning the foundations of JavaScript, I then took on two WOD(workout of the day) challenges. WOD takes a different approach to teaching programming as it utilizes athletic engineering which is a new pedagogical approach to teaching programming. Using this technique, we are tasked with completing a coding problem within a certain time limit. 
### WOD 1  
  For the first WOD, I did not struggle with this problem. I was able to get the desired results with relative ease. However, that does not mean I did extremely well on the problem. Reviewing the answer provided by the professor, I realized that my attempt was inefficient.
### WOD 2  
  For the second WOD, the challenge was slightly more difficult. I struggled with visualizing and planning out my code for this problem. However, I was still able to get the results that I needed and within a timely fashion. After finally completing the challenge, I realized that the problem was not as hard as I made it out to be. I mostly struggled with my confidence as a programmer. The imposter syndrome really got to me so I wasted a lot of time questioning whether I had the skill to complete this challenge. I also found that my code was inefficient compared to the code from the professor. In comparison, my code had a complexity of n squared while the professorâ€™s had a complexity of n.
## My impression of a WOD   
  From my experience, I have found WODs to be extremely stressful. Any assessment that I take tends to make me anxious. In terms of the difficulty of the problems, I would not say that they are extremely difficult. However, I have found that I tend to overthink when taking assessments. As a result, I waste a lot of time trying to visualize the problem. There is also the problem of my code being too complex and inefficient. With WODs, I have to take a different approach to learning. Instead of thinking of the WOD as a grade, I want to be able to think of it as an opportunity to learn and improve myself as a programmer. In this way, I believe that I will genuinely be able to become proficient in the skills that I learn.
