## Why Software Engineering?
 I was first introduced to the software engineering field through social media. Nowadays, with a technology and data-driven society, these types of careers are really common. I was initially drawn to the career because of the money. However, as I continued to take more computer science classes, I became interested in the field. I enjoyed the challenge that came with computer science. It was not something that came to me easily, so it required a lot of effort and time to develop my skills. From software engineering, I am intrigued by the aspect of people using and enjoying the applications that I create. If the applications that I program can help people solve problems or at least make technology easier and more accessible, then I think it would be a good reward for the time I put in to develop the necessary skills. Specifically, web development seems like something interesting and fun to do. However, I am open to the other aspects of software engineering.

## My Ambitions
For my second year of my computer science class, I am taking ICS 314, which is a software engineering course. From ICS 314, I hope to possibly discover and explore my passions in computer science. While I do find computer science interesting, I have not found a specific career or field that I am infatuated with. There are a couple of fields that I would like to consider including software engineering. I want to explore what being a software engineer entails. As of right now, I am learning the basics of JavaScript and I have enjoyed doing so. I would like to continue learning new programming languages. My main interest in the class is building bigger-scale projects. In the previous computer science classes that I took, they were all minor scale assignments. Building these applications and actually seeing them function is something that I would like to see in the future of this class.

I would also like to experience what it is like to work in a computer science career. Whether that be through an internship or an actual job, I want to know what it is like to work in a technology industry. Through the course, I know there will be a lot of group projects so working on a computer science project with others is exciting for me. Especially because in my previous computer science classes, there were no group assignments.
