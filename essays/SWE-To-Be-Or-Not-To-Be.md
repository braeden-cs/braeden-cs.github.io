### My Journey To Becoming a SWE:
  <p>Over the past semester of my computer science degree, I have been taking a software engineering class which has introduced me to various frameworks and languages such as JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and React. More importantly, I have become mildly aware of some foundational software engineering concepts and practices including:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Open Source Software Development </li>
    <li> Configuration Management </li>
    <li> Functional Programming </li>
    <li> Development Environments </li>
    <li> Coding Standards </li>
    <li> User Interface Frameworks </li>
    <li> Agile Project Management </li>
    <li> Design Patterns </li>
    <li> Ethics in Software Engineering </li>
  </ol>

  <p>More than just the web-development focused technology stack encompassed within the class, I have learned far more skills towards becoming better in my academic and professional career. From learning how to better manage the projects that I work on and who I am working with, to determining whether my actions are ethical in retrospect, these skills are not only applicable within the scope of software engineering but also within various aspects of my life. </p>
  

### To Be a SWE:
  <p>In the beginning of my journey, I was confronted with a big question that would determine and shape my path for the next major era of my life: "Why Software Engineering?" While I am still on the ropes about what careers to consider in computer science, I have become more sure about my motivations. Much more than just technical stack and hard skills I have acquired throughout this software engineering class, I have found the soft skills to be much more practical and enjoyable. The aspects of communication and team building within this class were worthwhile. From working together and staying up to late to make sure that we finish the assignment on time to struggling and helping each other figure out why our code is not working, my experience with working on a bigger-scale coding project is one that I will remember as I carry on in my computer science degree. My main goal of taking this software engineering class, more than anything, was to experience what it was like to work with my peers on a big project so as to give me insight on what it is like to work in the profession. Although it was rigorous and a struggle at some points, I believe I was able to achieve this. Now, I feel even more motivated to impprove my practices in order to become a reliable software engineer. </p>
