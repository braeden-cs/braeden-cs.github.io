## My Journey To Becoming a SWE
  <p>Over the past semester of my computer science degree, I have been taking a software engineering class which has introduced me to various frameworks and languages such as JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and React. More importantly, I have become mildly aware of some foundational software engineering concepts and practices including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Open Source Software Development </li>
    <li> Configuration Management </li>
    <li> Functional Programming </li>
    <li> Development Environments </li>
    <li> Coding Standards </li>
    <li> User Interface Frameworks </li>
    <li> Agile Project Management </li>
    <li> Design Patterns </li>
    <li> Ethics in Software Engineering </li>
  </ul>

  <p>More than just the web-development focused technology stack encompassed within the class, I have learned far more skills towards becoming better in my academic and professional career. From learning how to better manage the projects that I work on and who I am working with, to determining whether my actions are ethical in retrospect, these skills are not only applicable within the scope of software engineering but also within various aspects of my life. </p>

## Issue Driven Project Management
  <p>The most pivotal software engineering concept that I have learned is Agile Project Management. Specifically, I have delved into the issue driven project managament method. In essence, this approach is a SMART way of tackling a project. The backbone of IDPM is efficiency, organization, and communication. It focuses on creating issues that are reasonably obtainable and well-ordered. To do this, GitHub issues are created based on certain criteria. The main of which is ensuring that the tasks of the project as split up accordingly so they are able to be completed within 3-days. The issues must be thoughtfully broken down so there is no over-reliability on a member finishing their task. Even if any breakdowns within the team were to occur, the project would still be able to be finished on time. In addition to this, each task for an issue is done within their own respective branch as to prevent any conflicting merges. Each branch must be named according to their corresponding issue. Finally, to overcome the biggest hurdle of project managament, meetings and milestones are required to encourage communication and accoutability. Each member is able to keep track of who got what done through these meeting and milestones. By doing so, it holds up expectations within the group the dynamic that each member is equally contributing.</p>
  <p>I have had a good experience with such a structured way of project managment. The attribute that I appreciate the most out of this method is its underlying pressure for accountability within the group.</p>
  
### Well Oiled Machine or Powerhouse? Why Not Both?
  <p>Outside of the scope of software engineering, Agile Project Management is a very efficient and practical way of doing projects. One of the aspects of academics that I have grown to hate over my educational career is group projects. The though of working with others is not so scary and can be quite fun, however, in pratice, things can go awry in the blink of an eye. There are so many factors that is incredibly difficult to keep track of by just one person. The lack of reliability and work ethic from my group mates in addition to the absence of communication always leads the project to disaster. This is where agile project management comes into play. From my perspective, IDPM goes against the typical standard of administering projects. Rather than a group being just a well-oiled machine, it focuses on each member being a powerhouse in their own right so that even if a cog goes missing, the project can still run smoothly. As discussed before, the attributes of agile project management would greatly solve the issues that I have been running into with group projects all too often.</p>

## Ethical Software Engineering
  <p>The software engineering concept that is prevelant and urgent within today's society is ethics. In the most basic sense, ethics is what is deemed as right or wrong.</p>
  <p>Ethics is not just sofware engineering but for life in its entirety. As with any industry, ethics is one of the most important things to consider. It potently influences what we are doing and why we are doing it.Ethics in software engineering have been some of the most challenging and controversial </p>

## To Be a SWE
  <p>In the beginning of my journey, I was confronted with a big question that would determine and shape my path for the next major era of my life: "Why Software Engineering?" While I am still on the ropes about what careers to consider in computer science, I have become more sure about my motivations. Much more than just technical stack and hard skills I have acquired throughout this software engineering class, I have found the soft skills to be much more practical and enjoyable. The aspects of communication and team building within this class were worthwhile. From working together and staying up to late to make sure that we finish the assignment on time to struggling and helping each other figure out why our code is not working, my experience with working on a bigger-scale coding project is one that I will remember as I carry on in my computer science degree. My main goal of taking this software engineering class, more than anything, was to experience what it was like to work with my peers on a big project so as to give me insight on what it is like to work in the profession. Although it was rigorous and a struggle at some points, I believe I was able to achieve this. Now, I feel even more motivated to impprove my practices in order to become a reliable software engineer. </p>
