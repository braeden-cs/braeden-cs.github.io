In my spring semester of my junior year of highschool, I competed in a state-wide competition for the HOSA organization in the medical math event. In this event, I was primarily tested on medical terminology, dosages, and reading prescriptions out of the many other topics. Medical Math is typically a course that is taught by itself at universities which shows its importance in the medical field. I was tasked with learning the medical math material within two to three months. It was my first time competing in the event so I had no prior knowledge about the subject.

I was entirely responsible with becoming proficient with medical math through a textbook. I dedicated one to two hours everyday prior to the competition going over the material. This was all occurring while I was taking some of the most difficult courses in my school at the time. I would also stay after school to work with my teacher on  medical math practice problems. For eaach unit that I would go through, I would take a practice quiz which incredibly boosted my understanding of the content.

From my experience competing in this event, I have improved my work-ethic and motivation to learn. All of this occurred during COVID-19 where education and the motivation to learn was at an all-time low. Finding the time and conjuring up the effort to self-study a whole new subject was extremely challenging, however, I enjoyed my time doing so. I also learned how to collaborate with teachers and those in higher authority. Without the help and encouragement of my teacher, I most likely would not have been able to do as well as I did.
