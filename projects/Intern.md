During the fall semester of the 2023-2024 academic year, I worked as a student engineering intern for the Department of Transportation, Airports department. Through this position, I learned more about the daily processes and responsibilities of an engineer. The airports department worked on statewide airport projects which includes routine maintenance of the airports to more special projects. I worked directly with the engineers and secretaries to ensure that these projects would run smoothly.

In terms of my responsilities, I was in charge of ensuring that the change orders for the projects were reviewed and approved in a timely manner. This ensured that the airport projects could process and run as efficiently as possible. I also created projects on our system for the engineers to use so they can upload and access project documents. Minor responsibilities included scanning, uploading, and organizing documents. From this internship, I majorly learned how to work in a team.
