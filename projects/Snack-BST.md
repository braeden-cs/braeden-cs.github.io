summary: "Creating a Binary Search Tree of Snacks"
---



During my fall semester of my second year in my computer science degree, I was assigned to create a binary search tree with nodes that contained snack objects. These snack objects contained the price, calories, barcode, and name of the snack. 

I was first responsible with creating the snack objects. Each of the snack object's parameters had to be validated in order for the snack to be created. I would also end up creating a snack exception in the case that an exception is thrown in the snack class. I was also responsible for creating the nodes containing the snacks. Finally, I had to link the nodes together based on the logic of a binary search tree. In this class, I would define how to add nodes and print the tree. Also, I would delete and find the snack nodes based on their barcodes.

From this assignment, I learned the basics of a binary search tree and how to apply this concept through code. It was my first time dealing with a binary search tree so there were many trials and tribulations with programming the Snack BST. It was also a project that we were slowly building upon throughout the semester. This project was so significant to me as it would teach me perserverance and determination despite being frustrated. There were many times where my code would not compile or simply not function correctly. In those instances, I would want to give up. However, I decided to push through the frustation. In the end, I was able to create a program that I was satisfied with.
