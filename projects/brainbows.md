summary: "A Study Buddy App for UH Manoa ICS students"
---

<img class="img-fluid" src="../img/final-landing.png">

My group and I created a study buddy app for UH Manoa ICS students. The main issue that we found within the ICS department, and in academics in general, is that it can be difficult to find friends to study with. Especially since having a study partner is integral to your academic success and experience, making a study buddy app that makes finding mentors and study buddys much easier would be extremely beneficial for ICS students.
